## Social & Coding Profiles

I'm not the most active on social media as I feel that you can end up spending to much of your life endlessly scrolling and achieving nothing with your time.

<b>Stack Overflow is KING!</b> The number one go to resource to find answers for development questions.<br>
I have only recently set up my npm.js and packagist accounts, they do not currently have any content but in the future I hope to develope packages that are of use not just to myself but the wider community and they will be made available through my accounts below.

## Development Stack and Technologies

### Current coding setup

I code everyday on my MacBook Pro, setup to run a local web server using Homebrew. My IDE of choice is PHPstorm however if we were to just be going for freely available IDE's I would highly suggest using Microsofts Visual Studio Code. And for my day to day text edting needs I use the wonderful Sublime Text editor.

Whenever I need to check out any API's or test my own developed endpoints Postman is my go to tool for this and you really have to hand it to the developers of this great piece of software, it'e easy to use and the free version covers almost all use cases.
